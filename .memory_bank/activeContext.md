# Active Context

## Current State
- Project in initial development phase
- Specification defined in specs/0001-idea.md
- Implementation not yet started

## Development Focus
- Setting up project structure and memory bank for tracking progress
- Initial implementation planning

## Implementation Priorities
1. Set up basic CLI structure with clap
2. Implement Cargo.toml parser to extract dependencies
3. Implement Cargo.lock parser to resolve versions
4. Develop registry path resolution logic
5. Integrate codebank for generating dependency documentation
6. Add token calculation with tokenizers
7. Create reporting for generated files

## Technical Considerations
- Need to handle cross-platform path differences
- Must efficiently traverse directory structures to find Cargo.toml files
- Should implement proper error handling for missing dependencies
- Need to ensure token calculation is accurate for large files

## Open Questions
- How to handle dependencies with custom registry sources?
- Should there be a way to exclude certain dependencies?
- What should be done if a dependency's source code is not available locally?
- Are there performance concerns for very large projects with many dependencies?
