  - Features:
    - Skips hidden directories
    - Error handling for non-existent directories
    - Comprehensive test coverage

- [x] Dependency parser
  - Status: Implemented
  - Notes: Used toml and serde crates to parse Cargo.toml files
  - Features:
    - Parses regular, dev, and build dependencies
    - Handles both simple and detailed dependency specifications
    - Extracts version information

- [x] Version resolver
  - Status: Implemented
  - Notes: Used toml crate to parse Cargo.lock files
  - Features:
    - Automatically finds Cargo.lock in current or parent directories
    - Maps dependency requirements to exact versions
    - Handles multiple versions of the same package

- [x] Registry path resolver
  - Status: Implemented
  - Notes: Uses dirs and std::fs to find and select the most recent registry
  - Features:
    - Locates the .cargo registry directory
    - Finds the most recently modified registry index
    - Provides meaningful errors for non-existent registries

- [x] Dependency path constructor
  - Status: Implemented
  - Notes: Combines registry path with dependency name and version
  - Features:
    - Constructs full paths to dependency source code
    - Provides a utility to check if dependencies are available locally
    - Handles all dependencies in a single call

- [x] Code bank generator
  - Status: Implemented
  - Notes: Uses codebank crate to generate documentation for dependencies
  - Features:
    - Generates summary documentation in Markdown format
    - Creates individual files for each dependency
    - Handles errors gracefully when generating multiple code banks

- [x] Token calculator
  - Status: Implemented
  - Notes: Uses tokenizers crate with a pretrained BERT model
  - Features:
    - Calculates token counts for individual files and directories
    - Provides detailed file stats including size and token count
    - Supports filtering by file extension

## CLI Implementation
- [x] Command-line interface
  - Status: Implemented
  - Notes: Used clap crate for argument parsing and subcommand structure
  - Features:
    - Three subcommands: generate, tokens, list
    - Comprehensive help documentation
    - Progress reporting during operations
    - Support for various options like dry-run and output path
  - Commands:
    - generate: Creates code banks for all dependencies
    - tokens: Calculates tokens for files or directories
    - list: Lists all dependencies with optional detailed information

## Testing
- [x] Test fixtures
  - Status: Implemented
  - Notes: Created various test fixtures to simulate different project scenarios
  - Features:
    - Simple project with basic dependencies
    - Complex project with feature flags and optional dependencies
    - Workspace project with multiple packages
    - Empty project with no dependencies
    - Custom registry project for testing alternative registry sources

- [x] Unit tests
  - Status: Implemented
  - Notes: Added comprehensive unit tests for core functionality
  - Features:
    - Tests for dependency parsing with various formats
    - Tests for version resolution with multiple versions
    - Tests for handling overlapping dependencies
    - Testing with mock files and directories using tempfile crate

- [x] Integration tests
  - Status: Implemented
  - Notes: Added integration tests for CLI functionality
  - Features:
    - Tests all CLI subcommands (generate, tokens, list)
    - Tests different flag combinations
    - Tests behavior with various fixture projects
    - Tests error handling and edge cases

## Documentation

  - Status: Implemented
  - Notes: Comprehensive documentation of installation and usage
  - Features:
    - Project description and features
    - Installation instructions
    - Command usage with examples
    - Detailed examples of common workflows

- [x] User guide
  - Status: Implemented
  - Notes: Created USAGE.md with detailed user documentation
  - Features:
    - Detailed explanations of all commands and options
    - Examples for different project types
    - Guidance on token calculations and optimization
    - Troubleshooting section with common issues

- [x] API documentation
  - Status: Implemented
  - Notes: Added rustdoc comments to all public API elements
  - Features:
    - Crate-level documentation with examples
    - Function-level documentation with parameters, returns, and errors
    - Type documentation with usage examples
    - Cross-references between related functions

## Project Status
